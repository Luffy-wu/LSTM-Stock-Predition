# Apply LSTM to predicting future trends of stock price
Taking 8 types of trading data of CSI300 Index constituent shares from Jan.1st 2006 to Jul.31st 2018 as samples, constructed RNN and LSTM models to predict the next rolling periodâ€™s returns / price trends respectively; besides, standardized data with different ways, adjusted parameters, increased data by transformation, tried different ways to prevent over-fitting (dropout & L2 regularization) to optimize prediction accuracy. As a result, it found that prediction on price trends performed much better, and the out-of-sample test accuracy reached 73%.
